# Pastr

Welcome to our Realtime Collaborative Text Editor! This web application allows users to create and collaborate on text in real time. Each user can go to any path, paste text, and see live updates as others contribute to the document. The application utilizes websockets for live communication and provides auto-save functionality on keystrokes.

## Usage

1. **Accessing the Editor:**
   - Visit our website at [pastr-backend.onrender.com](https://pastr-backend.onrender.com/).
   - Use any path you like, for example, [pastr-backend.onrender.com/example-path-here](https://pastr-backend.onrender.com/example-path-here).

2. **Creating/Editing Text:**
   - Once on the desired path, you can start typing or paste text into the editor.
   - Changes will be saved in real time and visible to all users with the same URL.

3. **Sharing:**
   - Share the URL with friends or colleagues to collaborate in real time.
   - The path in the URL is unique to your document, so make sure to share the complete URL for collaboration.

4. **Live Updates:**
   - Experience live updates as others type or edit the document simultaneously.
   - Websockets enable seamless communication for a real-time collaborative writing experience.

5. **Auto-save:**
   - Your document is auto-saved on every keystroke, ensuring that your work is continuously backed up.
